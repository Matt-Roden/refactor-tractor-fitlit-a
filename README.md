## Objectives

- Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
- Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
- Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
- Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
- Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process

## Technology Stack

`JavaScript` `HTML` `SCSS` `Mocha` `Chai` `WebPack` `Git` `GitHub` 

## Setup

1. Clone the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page) when you navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

## Achievements

- Using inheritance in the class structure to pass down methods and properties.
- Implementing fetch requests (GET) for data population in the application.
- Using Promis.all to handle ofetch requests.
- Moving all DOM mainpulation to an updateDOM file.
- Achieving a 97% score on the Lighthouse accessability test.
- Implementing `chart.js`
- Implementing Sass variables.

## Future Iterations

- Display all info for every card.
- Add login screen in order to eliminate the random index value function when instantiating a current User.
- Restructure HTML to gain more control of card sections and styling.
- Implement POST request, allowing for a user to sign up.
