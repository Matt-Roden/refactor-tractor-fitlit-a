## Objectives

- Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
- Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
- Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
- Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process

## Setup

1. Clone the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page) when you navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`
